# What will your learning environment really feel like?
This is a web app that enables current and incoming University of Waterloo students to visualize the environmental conditions in their classrooms and learning spaces, and compare them to industry standards for minimum/maximum allowable temperature, humidity, light, and sunlight. 

This was one of three design options that were prototyped by our team to deliver information to students and empower them to advocate for better learning conditions and improved quality of life on campus. 

The web app displays 4 interactive plots with data that we collected over the course of one week in 3 environments (an engineering classroom, a university library, and an engineering study lounge. 

Data was gathered using a portable data collection unit that we designed. The wearable device was run by an Arduino, with code written in C. 

This app was written in Python using Dash and Pandas and created by Malak Ali and Matthew Kee, designed by Joy He, with contributions from Ada Hong and Martha Matsui.
